# Diabetes Progression Modeling using Artificial Neural Networks

This project models the progression of diabetes using the Diabetes dataset from the `sklearn` library. The goal is to help healthcare professionals understand how different factors influence diabetes progression, aiding in the design of better treatment plans and preventive measures.

## Objective

To build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts diabetes progression based on patient data. The model explores the dynamics of diabetes using independent variables and provides insights that may be beneficial in clinical settings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Diabetes dataset** available in `sklearn`. This dataset includes multiple predictor variables (features) that influence the progression of diabetes.
